# What the Stop gate says, and the three judgments behind it: which payload
# field downgraded a block, whether the changed files reach the quality gate,
# and how the failures the steps collected become one summary and one body.
# Running the steps, reading the payload off stdin, entering the tree and
# encoding the JSON stay in stop-gate.sh, which sources this file, so
# stop-gate-decision.test.ts reaches every sentence below in one bash process
# without building a scratch git repository.
#
# stop-gate.sh sets these options too, and they are here as well so the test
# driver judges under the same ones. `-e` is absent from both: a step that
# fails is collected and reported rather than ending the gate.

# `stop_hook_active` is Claude Code's "this Stop was already blocked once"
# flag. Cursor's stop payload carries `loop_count` (auto-followups already
# triggered) instead, and it runs Claude-registered stop hooks with NO loop
# limit (loop_limit defaults to null for third-party hooks), so without this
# mapping a pre-existing failure would re-block forever there.
# `warning_message` quotes the name this prints, so a Cursor turn reads
# `loop_count` rather than a Claude field its payload never carried.

# The quality gate runs only when one of the changed paths carries one of these
# suffixes, so a docs-only turn skips typecheck, lint, format and the test
# suite. The paths arrive newline-delimited and whole, because a split on
# whitespace would truncate a filename containing a space and skip the gate for
# it. `case` reads each line where a `grep -q` would close the pipe on the
# first match: under `set -o pipefail` the SIGPIPE that kills the `printf`
# feeding it takes the pipeline to 141, which reads here as no match (measured
# on a 20001-line list, macOS, 2026-09-09).
