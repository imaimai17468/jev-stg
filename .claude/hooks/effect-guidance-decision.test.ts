/**
 * Exercise `guidance_reminder` in .claude/hooks/effect-guidance-decision.sh
 * against the three judgments it makes: which tool names write a file, which
 * paths hold Effect code, and which import spellings count as Effect.
 *
 * Every case here reaches the same code .claude/hooks/effect-guidance-reminder.sh
 * runs. effect-guidance-reminder.test.ts forks the hook instead, because what
 * it judges is the payload the hook reads, the marker file that silences the
 * second reminder of a session, and the JSON it prints.
 *
 * The whole table is answered before the first test runs, by one bash process
 * that sources the decision file once and reads NUL-delimited triples off
 * stdin. A case is then a synchronous comparison.
 *
 * A case asserts the whole reminder rather than that something was printed, so
 * rewording the sentence fails here and the reword reaches a reader who has to
 * agree with it.
