 * Fenced, not indented, on purpose: this checker does not treat 4-space-indented
 * blocks as code (see `stripCode`), so an indented example here would be scanned
 * as prose and reported as a dead link.
 *
 * Exists because the review pipeline was being used as a link checker. A dead
 * link is decidable by opening the path, so it belongs in a gate rather than in a
 * reviewer's judgment.
 *
 * It answers exactly one question: does the target of a relative link resolve to
 * something on disk? Anchors are not validated (the target's heading structure is
 * a different problem) and external URLs are not fetched (a gate must not depend
 * on the network). Returns a non-zero exit code when any link is dead.
