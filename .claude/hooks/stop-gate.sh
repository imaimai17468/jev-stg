# Stop combined gate:
# 1. Quality gate — typecheck / lint / format, then the test suite (blocking)
#    — the dead-code and duplication checks are not here: their verdict is a
#      property of more than this turn's diff, so CI runs `fallow dead-code`
#      and lefthook's pre-push runs `fallow dupes`
#    — runs only when code-relevant files changed (docs-only turns skip it)
# 2. Markdown link check — blocking; dead relative links are decidable by opening
#    the path, so they belong here rather than in a reviewer's judgment
#
# Every step above runs even after an earlier one failed, and one block names
# all of them, so no failure waits for a later Stop to be reported. That block
# downgrades to a warning instead of blocking again when the payload says this
# Stop already triggered a followup, so a pre-existing failure the agent cannot
# fix does not loop forever. The warning names which field said so.
#
# This file reads the payload, enters the tree, runs the steps and encodes the
# JSON. What the gate says, which payload field downgrades a block and whether
# the changed files reach the quality gate all live in stop-gate-decision.sh,
# which this file sources.
