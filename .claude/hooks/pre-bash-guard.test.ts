/**
 * Exercise .claude/hooks/pre-bash-guard.sh against the payloads it reads and
 * the JSON it prints.
 *
 * What the guard refuses is decided in pre-bash-guard-decision.sh, and
 * pre-bash-guard-decision.test.ts drives that file's `guard_refusal` over the
 * command table without forking the hook. What is left here is the entry's
 * own: which tool names reach the guards, what happens when the decision file
 * cannot be loaded, what the command it reads out of the payload is, and the
 * deny JSON in both dialects with the exit status and the empty stderr that
 * travel with it.
 *
 * One refusal sentence is spelled out below even though pre-bash-guard-decision.sh
 * is what words it. A deny case asserts the whole object jq built, and the
 * sentence is what says it reached both of that object's dialects unchanged
 * through the command substitution that read it. Rewording that branch of the
 * guard therefore fails a case here too.
 *
 * Every case forks the hook, which forks jq of its own, so the cases of this
 * file run concurrently. Nothing in the repository is modified and no command
 * from a case is ever executed.
