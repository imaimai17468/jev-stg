/**
 * Exercise `guard_refusal` in .claude/hooks/pre-bash-guard-decision.sh against
 * every command shape the guard must judge: one per branch it can refuse on,
 * the shapes its early-outs let through, and the quoting, heredoc and
 * expansion forms earlier versions of the guard read wrong.
 *
 * Every case here reaches the same code .claude/hooks/pre-bash-guard.sh runs.
 * pre-bash-guard.test.ts forks the hook instead, because what it judges is the
 * payload the hook reads and the JSON it prints. Nothing in the repository is
 * modified and no command from a case is ever executed.
 *
 * The whole table is answered before the first test runs, by one bash process
 * that sources the decision file once and answers the commands it reads
 * NUL-delimited on stdin. A case is then a synchronous comparison and carries
 * none of the driver's wall time.
 *
 * A case in the first table asserts the whole refusal sentence, so a branch
 * that answers with another branch's reason fails there. A case in a group
 * below asserts allow or block, because what a group covers is which shapes
 * reach a branch at all.
