 * become one summary and one body, and the sentence each outcome prints.
 *
 * Every case here reaches the same code .claude/hooks/stop-gate.sh runs,
 * through one bash process for the whole file: the driver below sources the
 * decision file once and evaluates the snippets it reads NUL-delimited on
 * stdin, each inside a command substitution so one case's collected failures
 * do not reach the next. stop-gate.test.ts builds a scratch git repository with
 * stub steps per case instead, because what it judges is which steps the gate
 * ran and which tree it judged them in.
