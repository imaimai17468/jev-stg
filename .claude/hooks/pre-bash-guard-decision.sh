# The decision behind the PreToolUse(Bash) guard: given one command's text,
# `guard_refusal` prints the sentence that refuses it, and prints nothing for a
# command the three guards below allow. Reading the hook payload off stdin and
# printing the refusal in each harness's dialect stay in pre-bash-guard.sh,
# which sources this file.
#
# Nothing here starts a process. Every text pass below runs as parameter
# expansion, `[[ =~ ]]` or `case` in the shell that sources this file. One
# PreToolUse call end to end through pre-bash-guard.sh, on a payload carrying
# `git commit -m 'feat: add the thing'`, took 174 ms, 175 ms and 158 ms over
# three rounds of 20 calls, where an entry that reads the same payload and
# sources this file without calling a guard took 141 ms, 202 ms and 148 ms over
# three rounds of its own: the same range, so the three guards now cost less
# than the noise between rounds (macOS under parallel load, 2026-09-09). The 294
# cases of pre-bash-guard-decision.test.ts answer in 0.41 s of that file's load.
#
# pre-bash-guard.sh sets these options too, and they are here as well so the
# test driver runs the guards under the same ones.

#
#   - A broad search root. `find . -type f | xargs cat` reads every file in the
#     repository — including the local env file, which under the standing
#     drizzle-kit exception can hold a real D1 API token — using only allow-listed commands.

#   - `-exec` / `-delete` and relatives. These reach past the `rm -rf` prefixes in
#     `deny` and can run an arbitrary command per match.
#
# Over-matching is the safe direction here: an unnecessary prompt costs a

# --- Guard 3: a git add or git commit that takes changes nobody named ---

# bare `*` name no file of their own; a glob in an operand's first component
# reaches the whole tree, so `git add '*.ts'` from the root staged every `.ts`
# in the scratch repository; `:/` and `:(top)` each staged all of it from a
# subdirectory; and `git stage` ran the same builtin (git 2.50.1, 2026-09-08).
# `git add -p` keeps working: it selects hunks instead of sweeping the tree.
#
# `git commit` reaches that same set in one step, so it is walked too. `-a`,
# `--all` and a cluster carrying `a` each committed both modified files of the
# scratch repository, and so did a blanket pathspec with no flag at all
# (`git commit -m x .`, `-- .`, `'*.txt'` and `':/'` each committed both),
# because git reads a pathspec as `--only` when neither `--include` nor
# `--only` is given. commit's `-u` is `--untracked-files`, a display mode that
# staged nothing, so that letter is refused for `git add` and allowed here
# (git 2.50.1, 2026-09-09). `--include`/`--only` with no pathspec needs no
# branch of its own: git answered
# `fatal: No paths with --include/--only does not make sense.`
#
# `git rm` reads its operands as a pathspec too, and reaches the whole tree the
# same way. Run as `git rm -n` against a scratch repository holding `a.txt`,
# `sub/b.txt` and `old-dir/c.txt`, each of `-r .`, `-r -- .`, `-rf .`,
# `--cached -r .`, `-r ./`, `-r :/`, `-r :(top)`, `-r '*'` and `'*.txt'` listed
# all three, where `-r old-dir` listed that directory's file alone and a bare
# `git rm` answered `fatal: No pathspec was given. Which files should I
# remove?` (git 2.50.1, 2026-09-09). Every option `git rm -h` lists apart from
# `--pathspec-from-file` (dry-run, quiet, cached, force, `-r`, ignore-unmatch,
# sparse, pathspec-file-nul) changes how it removes rather than which paths, so
# its operands decide the refusal and its walk carries no flag branch of its
# own.
#
# The text is Guard 1's SCRUBBED, so a `git`/`gh` message body quoting a refused
# shape stays prose, plus one more heredoc drop so a body written under any other
# command is prose too. The command is then split on `;|&()` and on newlines,
# because the shapes a reviewer used against Guard 2 reach this guard as well:
# `git add "."`, `git  add  -A`, `git status && git add -A`, and
# `GIT_DIR=x git add .`.
#
# `git` has to open the segment, behind nothing but assignments and a wrapper
# such as `env`, `sh -c` or `xargs`. That anchor is what leaves
# `rg 'git add .' src` unattended instead of refusing a search for the text it
# looks for. Two routes stay out of reach: a shell function or a script file,
# which no token walk sees, and an operand whose value only the shell holds, so
# `git add "$FILE"` and `git add $(git diff --name-only)` pass as named paths.
# `$PWD` and `pwd` are the exception, and the rewrite below spells them `.`.
# This binds the habit rather than a deliberate bypass.
#
# The shell drops a quote pair and a backslash from a word, so `g""it`, `\-A`
# and `\*` all reach git undecorated; Guard 1 normalizes the same two
# decorations at UNQUOTED for the same reason.

# Set REFUSED to the reason one operand takes more than it names, and leave it
