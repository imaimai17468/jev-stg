# Motion Craft

Read Part 1 when deciding how a motion should feel, Part 2 when writing the
value, Part 3 before calling animation work done, and Part 4 when the user
describes an effect without naming it.

# Part 1 — Design Philosophy

How Apple builds interfaces that feel like an extension of you, translated for
the web. From Apple's WWDC design talks — chiefly *Designing Fluid Interfaces*
(WWDC 2018).

The through-line: **an interface feels alive when motion starts from the current
on-screen value, inherits the user's velocity, projects momentum forward, and
can be grabbed and reversed at any instant.** Springs make this natural because
they are inherently interruptible and velocity-aware.

## The Core Idea

> "When we align the interface to the way we think and move, something magical
> happens — it stops feeling like a computer and starts feeling like a seamless
> extension of us."

An interface is fluid when it behaves like the physical world: things respond
instantly, move continuously, carry momentum, resist at boundaries, and can be
redirected mid-motion.

Apple frames design as serving four human needs: **safety/predictability,
understanding, achievement, and joy.**

## 1. Response — kill latency

The moment lag appears, the feeling of directness "falls off a cliff."

- **Respond on pointer-down, not on release.** Highlight a button the instant
  it's pressed. Waiting for `click`/touch-up to show feedback feels dead.
- **Be vigilant about every latency.** Audit debounces, artificial timers,
  transition waits, and the ~300ms tap delay.
- **Feedback must be continuous *during* the interaction, not just at the end.**
  For a drag, slider, or drawer, update the UI 1:1 with the pointer the whole
  way through.

## 2. Direct manipulation — 1:1 tracking

> "Touch and content should move together."

When the user drags something, it must stay glued to the finger — and respect
the offset from *where they grabbed it*. Snapping to the element's center on
grab breaks the illusion immediately.

- Use Pointer Events with `setPointerCapture` so tracking continues even when
  the pointer leaves the element's bounds.
- Track a short **velocity/position history** (last few `pointermove` events),
  not just the current point — you'll need velocity at release.

## 3. Interruptibility — the single most important principle

> "The thought and the gesture happen in parallel."

Every animation must be interruptible and redirectable at any moment.

- **Never lock out input during a transition.**
- **Always animate from the *presentation* (current) value, never the target
  value.** On interrupt, read the element's live on-screen transform and start
  the new animation from there. Starting from the logical/target value causes a
  visible jump.
- **Avoid CSS transitions and `@keyframes` for anything gesture-driven** —
  they can't be smoothly grabbed and reversed mid-flight.
- **When a gesture reverses, blend velocity — don't hard-cut it.** Spring
  libraries that carry velocity through a re-target avoid the "brick wall."
- **Decompose 2D motion into independent X and Y springs.** A single spring on
  a 2D distance desyncs when X and Y have different velocities.

## 4. Behavior over animation — use springs

> "Think of animation as a conversation between you and the object, not
> something prescribed by the interface."

A pre-scripted, fixed-duration animation can't respond to new input. A spring
can — new input just changes the target, and the motion stays continuous.

Apple's two designer-friendly parameters:
- **Damping ratio** — controls overshoot. `1.0` = critically damped, no bounce.
  `< 1.0` = overshoots and oscillates.
- **Response** — how quickly the value reaches the target, in seconds. Lower =
  snappier. **This is not "duration"** — a spring has no fixed duration.

**Defaults:**
- Start most UI at **damping `1.0`** (critically damped).
- Add bounce (**damping ~`0.8`**) **only when the gesture itself carried
  momentum** (a flick, a throw, a drag release).

**Concrete values Apple ships:**

| Interaction | Damping | Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Move / reposition (e.g. PiP) | `1.0` | `0.4` |
| Rotation | `0.8` | `0.4` |
| Drawer / sheet | `0.8` | `0.3` |

```js
import { animate } from 'motion';

// Critically damped default (no overshoot)
animate(el, { y: 0 }, { type: 'spring', bounce: 0, duration: 0.4 });

// Momentum interaction — a little bounce, only because a flick preceded it
animate(el, { y: target }, { type: 'spring', bounce: 0.2, duration: 0.4 });
```

## 5. Velocity handoff

When a gesture ends, the animation must **continue at the finger's exact
velocity**, so there's no visible seam between dragging and animating.

Pass the pointer's release velocity as the spring's initial velocity. Some
spring APIs want **relative** velocity — normalize:

```
relativeVelocity = gestureVelocity / (targetValue - currentValue)
```

## 6. Momentum projection

> "Take a small input and make a big output."

Don't snap to the nearest boundary from the *release point*. Use velocity to
**project the resting position** — then snap to the target nearest that
projected point.

Apple's exact projection function:

```js
function project(initialVelocity, decelerationRate = 0.998) {
  return (initialVelocity / 1000) * decelerationRate / (1 - decelerationRate);
}

const projectedEndpoint = currentPosition + project(releaseVelocity);
const target = nearestSnapPoint(projectedEndpoint);
animateSpringTo(target, { velocity: releaseVelocity });
```

At release, the **sign of the velocity** decides between reverse and commit,
not the position the gesture reached.

## 7. Spatial consistency

> "If something disappears one way, we expect it to emerge from where it came."

- **Enter and exit along the same path.** A panel that slides in from the right
  must dismiss to the right.
- **Anchor interactions to their source.** A menu or popover originates from
  the element that triggered it, and `.claude/rules/design.md` (Animations)
  sets how.
- **Mirror the easing on reversible transitions** with the inverse
  cubic-bezier.

## 8. Hint in the direction of the gesture

Intermediate motion should telegraph where things are going — make the
in-between frames point at the outcome, not just interpolate blindly.

## 9. Rubber-banding — soft boundaries

At an edge, resist progressively instead of stopping hard.

```js
function rubberband(overshoot, dimension, constant = 0.55) {
  return (overshoot * dimension * constant) / (dimension + constant * Math.abs(overshoot));
}
```

## 10. Gesture design details

- **Tap:** highlight on touch-*down*, commit on touch-*up*. Add ~10px hysteresis
  and allow cancel-by-dragging-away.
- **Drag/swipe:** require a small movement threshold (~10px) before committing
  to a direction, then track 1:1.
- **Detect all plausible gestures in parallel from the first move**, then
  confidently cancel the losers once intent is clear.
- **Minimize disambiguation delays.** Double-tap detection delays single taps;
  only pay that cost where double-tap truly exists.

## 11. Frame-level smoothness

- Keep per-frame positional change below the perception threshold to avoid
  strobing.
- For very fast motion, a subtle **motion blur / stretch** reads better than a
  hard sharp streak.
- `requestAnimationFrame` is the web's display-synced clock. Which properties
  may animate is settled in `.claude/rules/design.md` (Animations).

## 12. Materials & depth

Apple uses translucent materials as a floating functional layer. On the web,
approximate with `backdrop-filter`. Which surfaces here may be translucent, and
where a shadow is allowed at all, is settled in `.claude/rules/design.md`
(Elevation), which carries hierarchy on background color, border, backdrop dim,
spacing, and typography instead.

- **Scroll edge effects, not hard dividers.** Fade a gradient mask where
  content meets floating chrome.
- **Materialize, don't just fade.** Animate blur radius and scale together on
  enter/exit, so the surface reads as a real material arriving.

```css
.toolbar {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6);
  backdrop-filter: blur(20px) saturate(180%);
  border-top: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4);
}
```

## 13. Multimodal feedback

Three rules for combining visual + sound + haptic:

1. **Causality** — trigger on the actual causal event, match character to action.
2. **Harmony** — visual, sound, and haptic must fire on the **same frame**.
3. **Utility** — reserve for meaningful moments (success, error, commit, snap).

## 14. Reduced motion & accessibility

`.claude/rules/design.md` sets what this repository does under
`prefers-reduced-motion` (Animations), and under
`prefers-reduced-transparency` and `prefers-contrast` (Elevation).

## 15. Typography — optical sizing, tracking, leading

- **Tracking and hierarchy.** Both are settled in `.claude/rules/design.md`
  (Typographic Rules, Typographic Pitfalls).
- **Leading tracks size inversely.** Tight on large headings, looser on body.
- **Respect the user's text-size setting.** Scale layout with `rem`/`em`.

```css
.display {
  font-size: clamp(2rem, 5vw, 4rem);
  line-height: 1.05;
  letter-spacing: -0.02em;
  font-optical-sizing: auto;
}
```

## 16. Design foundations — Apple's eight principles

1. **Purpose.** Make with intention; decide what *not* to build.
2. **Agency.** Keep people in control: offer choices, easy undo.
3. **Responsibility.** Privacy: ask at the right moment, only for what's needed.
4. **Familiarity.** Build on what people already know. Things that look the same
   must behave the same.
5. **Flexibility.** Design for different contexts, devices, and abilities.
6. **Simplicity — not minimalism.** Strip the unnecessary so the core purpose
   shines; hiding everything in one place isn't simple.
7. **Craft.** Uncompromising attention to detail builds trust. Every spacing,
   timing, and alignment value is a deliberate choice.
8. **Delight.** The result of getting the other seven right, not confetti tacked
   on top.

## 17. Process

- **Prototype interactively — an interactive demo is worth "a million static
  designs."** You discover the interface by building and playing with it; a
  working prototype sets a concrete bar that prevents a mediocre final
  implementation.
- **Design interaction and visuals together.** "You shouldn't be able to tell
  where one ends and the other begins." Motion is not a layer added after the
  pixels.
- **Test with real people in real context.** Part 2's Debugging section says
  how to review the motion itself.

# Part 2 — Implementation Reference

Precise values, curves, and techniques. Cite these in code and reviews.
Distilled from Emil Kowalski's design engineering philosophy (animations.dev).
What this repository's CSS and TSX must do is settled in
`.claude/rules/design.md` (Animations); this part is the reference behind it.

## Springs

Feel natural because they simulate physics; no fixed duration.

```js
// Apple-style (recommended)
{ type: "spring", duration: 0.5, bounce: 0.2 }

// Traditional physics (more control)
{ type: "spring", mass: 1, stiffness: 100, damping: 10 }
```

Keep bounce subtle (0.1-0.3); reserve for drag-to-dismiss and playful
interactions. Springs maintain velocity when interrupted.

## Asymmetric timing

Slow where the user is deciding, fast where the system responds.

```css
.overlay { transition: clip-path 200ms ease-out; }            /* release: fast */
.button:active .overlay { transition: clip-path 2s linear; }  /* press: slow */
```

## Performance

- **Animated properties.** `.claude/rules/design.md` (Animations) settles which
  properties may animate.
- **Motion (Framer Motion) shorthands `x`/`y`/`scale` are NOT
  hardware-accelerated.** They run on the main thread via rAF and drop frames
  under load. Use the full transform string:
  ```jsx
  <motion.div animate={{ transform: "translateX(100px)" }} />
  ```
- **CSS animations beat JS under load** — they run off the main thread.
- **WAAPI** gives JS control with CSS performance:
  ```js
  element.animate(
    [{ clipPath: 'inset(0 0 100% 0)' }, { clipPath: 'inset(0 0 0 0)' }],
    { duration: 1000, fill: 'forwards', easing: 'cubic-bezier(0.77, 0, 0.175, 1)' }
  );
  ```

## Transforms & clip-path

- **`translate` percentages** are relative to the element's own size —
  `translateY(100%)` moves by the element's height regardless of dimensions.
- **`scale()` scales children too** (font, icons, content).
- **3D**: `rotateX/Y` + `transform-style: preserve-3d` for depth/orbit/flip.
- **`clip-path: inset(t r b l)`** drives a hold-to-delete overlay, a seamless
  tab color transition, and a comparison slider. A reveal gated on scroll is
  ruled out by `.claude/rules/design.md` (Content States).

## Gestures & drag

- **Momentum dismissal**: compute velocity (`Math.abs(distance)/elapsedMs`);
  dismiss if `> ~0.11`. A flick should be enough.
- **Multi-touch protection**: ignore extra touch points after drag begins.

## Masking imperfect crossfades

When a crossfade shows two overlapping states, add subtle `filter: blur(2px)`
during the transition. Keep blur < 20px (heavy blur is expensive, especially
Safari).

## Stagger

`.claude/rules/design.md` (Animations) sets the delay between items and what a
stagger may not hold up.

```css
.item { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(8px); animation: fadeIn 300ms ease-out forwards; }
.item:nth-child(2) { animation-delay: 50ms; }
.item:nth-child(3) { animation-delay: 100ms; }
```

## Accessibility (implementation)

`.claude/rules/design.md` (Interactive States) gates hover animation and bounds
what a hover may change.

```css
@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine) {
  .card:hover .card-icon { transform: translateX(2px); }
}
```

## Debugging

- **Slow motion**: bump duration 2-5x or use DevTools animation inspector.
- **Frame-by-frame**: Chrome DevTools Animations panel.
- **Real devices** for gestures — connect a phone, hit the dev server by IP.
- **Fresh eyes next day** — imperfections invisible during development surface
  later.

# Part 3 — Review Standards

A specialized review posture for animation and motion code only. It does NOT
review general application logic, business code, or non-motion concerns. If
asked to review general code, decline and point to the `code-reviewer` agent. Default to flagging; approval is earned.

## Operating Posture

You are a senior design engineer with a brutal eye for craft. Your bias is
toward **motion that feels right**, not motion that merely runs. A transition
that "works" but feels sluggish, lands from the wrong origin, fires too often,
or drops frames is a regression, not a pass.

## The Ten Non-Negotiable Standards

Every animation in the diff is measured against these. A violation is a finding.

1. **Justified motion.** Every animation must answer "why does this animate?" —
   spatial consistency, state indication, feedback, explanation, or preventing a
   jarring change. "It looks cool" on a frequently-seen element is a block.

2. **Frequency-appropriate.** Measured against the frequency table in
   `.claude/rules/design.md` (Animations).

3. **Responsive easing.** Measured against the curve order in
   `.claude/rules/design.md` (Animations).

4. **Duration within range.** Measured against the duration table in
   `.claude/rules/design.md` (Animations).

5. **Origin & physical correctness.** Measured against the physicality rules in
   `.claude/rules/design.md` (Animations).

6. **Interruptibility.** Measured against `.claude/rules/design.md`
   (Animations) for CSS, and against Part 1 section 3 for gesture-driven
   motion.

7. **GPU-only properties.** Measured against `.claude/rules/design.md`
   (Animations). Motion's `x`/`y`/`scale` shorthands run on the main thread, so
   they are a finding on motion that plays while the page is busy.

8. **Accessibility.** Measured against `.claude/rules/design.md`: reduced
   motion in Animations, hover in Interactive States.

9. **Asymmetric enter/exit.** Measured against Part 2's Asymmetric timing.
   Symmetric timing on a press-and-release is a finding.

10. **Cohesion.** Motion matches the component's personality and the rest of the
    product. Mismatched personality is a finding. Where it is unclear whether
    the motion feels right, review it as Part 2's Debugging section says before
    deciding, and deleting it is often the strongest move.

## Remedial Preference Hierarchy

When proposing fixes, prefer earlier moves over later ones:

1. **Delete the animation.**
2. **Reduce it.**
3. **Fix the easing.**
4. **Fix the origin and physicality.**
5. **Make it interruptible.**
6. **Move it to the GPU.**
7. **Make the timing asymmetric.**
8. **Polish it.**
9. **Fix the accessibility gating and the cohesion.**

## Review Output Format

### Verdict (REQUIRED)

The report's first line is the decision, followed by the finding that decided
it.

- **Block** — any feel-breaking regression, animation on keyboard/high-frequency
  action, `scale(0)`/`ease-in` on UI, or non-GPU animation with an easy GPU fix.
- **Approve** — no feel-breaking regressions, durations and easing within
  bounds, interruptibility handled, reduced-motion respected.

### Findings table (REQUIRED)

| Before | After | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `transition: all 300ms` | `transition: transform 200ms ease-out` | `all` animates unintended properties off-GPU |
| `transform: scale(0)` | `transform: scale(0.95); opacity: 0` | Nothing appears from nothing |

### Findings by impact tier (REQUIRED)

Group by impact tier, highest first. Omit empty tiers.

1. **Feel-breaking regressions**
2. **Missed simplifications**
3. **Performance**
4. **Interruptibility & timing**
5. **Origin, physicality & cohesion**
6. **Accessibility**

Cite `file:line`. Pull exact values from `.claude/rules/design.md` and Part 2
rather than approximating.

# Part 4 — Animation Vocabulary

Turn a vague description of a motion effect into the precise term, so you know
what to ask for. When the user describes an effect loosely, return the matching
term(s) in the bold-term-then-definition form the sections below use.

If several terms could fit, list the best match first, then 1-2 alternates with
a one-line note on how they differ.

## Entrances & Exits

- **Fade in / Fade out** — Element appears or disappears by changing opacity.
- **Slide in** — Element enters by sliding in from off-screen.
- **Scale in** — Element grows from smaller to full size, often paired with fade.
- **Pop in** — Element appears with a slight overshoot, like it bounces into place.
- **Reveal** — Content is uncovered gradually, often by animating a clip-path or mask.
- **Enter / Exit** — The animation an element plays when added to or removed from the screen.

## Sequencing & Timing

- **Keyframes** — Defined points in an animation that the browser fills between.
- **Interpolation / Tween** — Generating all in-between frames for continuous motion.
- **Stagger** — Animate several items one after another with a small delay.
- **Orchestration** — Timing multiple animations so they feel like one coordinated motion.
- **Delay** — Time before an animation starts.
- **Duration** — How long an animation takes.
- **Fill mode** — Whether an element keeps its first or last frame's styles before/after.
- **Stepped animation** — Divided into discrete steps, like a countdown timer.

## Movement & Transforms

- **Translate** — Move along the X or Y axis.
- **Scale** — Make bigger or smaller.
- **Rotate** — Spin around a point.
- **Skew** — Slant along an axis, shearing out of rectangular shape.
- **3D tilt / Flip** — Rotate in 3D space (rotateX / rotateY) for depth.
- **Perspective** — How strong the 3D effect looks.
- **Transform origin** — The anchor point a scale or rotation grows/spins from.
- **Origin-aware animation** — An element animates out of its trigger, not its own center.

## Transitions Between States

- **Crossfade** — One element fades out as another fades in, in the same spot.
- **Continuity transition** — Visually connecting before and after to keep the user oriented.
- **Morph** — One shape smoothly turns into another (e.g. Dynamic Island).
- **Shared element transition** — An element travels and transforms from one position into another.
- **Layout animation** — Size or position changes animate instead of snapping.
- **Accordion / Collapse** — Smoothly expands and collapses height.
- **Direction-aware transition** — Content slides one way going forward, opposite going back.

## Scroll

- **Scroll reveal** — Elements fade or slide in as they enter the viewport.
- **Scroll-driven animation** — Progress tied directly to scroll position.
- **Parallax** — Background and foreground move at different speeds.
- **Page transition** — Animation when navigating from one page to another.
- **View transition** — Browser morphs between two states, connecting shared elements.

## Feedback & Interaction

- **Hover effect** — Visual change when the cursor moves over an element.
- **Press / Tap feedback** — Subtle scale-down when clicked, so it feels physical.
- **Hold to confirm** — Progress effect that fills while the user holds a button.
- **Drag** — Moving an element by grabbing it, often with momentum on release.
- **Drag to reorder** — Dragging items in a list to rearrange while others shift.
- **Swipe to dismiss** — Dragging off-screen to close (drawer, toast).
- **Rubber-banding** — Resistance and snap-back when dragging past a boundary.
- **Shake / Wiggle** — Quick side-to-side jitter signaling an error.
- **Ripple** — Circle expanding from the point of a tap.

## Easing (glossary)

- **Easing** — Rate at which an animation speeds up or slows down.
- **Ease-out** — Starts fast, ends slow. The default for most UI.
- **Ease-in** — Starts slow, ends fast. Usually avoided; can feel sluggish.
- **Ease-in-out** — Slow, fast, slow. Good for on-screen A-to-B movement.
- **Linear** — Constant speed. Reserve for spinners or marquees.
- **Cubic-bezier** — Custom easing curve for precise control.
- **Asymmetric easing** — Accelerates and decelerates at different rates.

## Spring Animations

- **Spring** — Motion driven by physics (tension, mass, damping) rather than duration.
- **Stiffness / Tension** — How strongly the spring pulls toward its target.
- **Damping** — How quickly a spring settles. Lower = more bounce.
- **Mass** — How heavy the animated element feels.
- **Bounce** — A spring that overshoots and settles.
- **Perceptual duration** — How long a spring feels finished, even while micro-settling.
- **Momentum** — Motion that carries velocity, especially after a drag.
- **Velocity** — How fast and in which direction an element is moving.
- **Interruptible animation** — Smoothly redirected mid-flight instead of finishing first.

## Looping & Ambient Motion

- **Marquee** — Text or content that scrolls continuously in a loop.
- **Loop** — An animation that repeats.
- **Alternate (yoyo)** — A loop that plays forward then reverses each iteration.
- **Orbit** — An element circling around another.
- **Pulse** — Gentle repeating scale or opacity change.
- **Float** — Continuous up-and-down drift, making a static element feel alive.
- **Idle animation** — Subtle motion while an element is waiting to be interacted with.

## Polish & Effects

- **Blur** — Softening an element or masking imperfections.
- **Clip-path** — Clipping to a shape for reveals, masks, and before/after sliders.
- **Mask** — Hiding or revealing parts with soft, fadeable edges.
- **Before / after slider** — Draggable divider wiping between two overlaid images.
- **Line drawing** — SVG path that draws itself in.
- **Text morph** — Text animating character by character when it changes.
- **Skeleton / Shimmer** — Placeholder with a moving sheen during loading.
- **Number ticker** — Digits rolling or counting up to a value.
- **Tabular numbers** — Fixed-width digits so numbers don't shift as they change.
- **Typewriter** — Text appearing one character at a time.

## Performance (glossary)

- **Frame rate (FPS)** — Frames per second. 60fps is baseline; 120fps on newer displays.
- **Jank** — Visible stutter from dropped frames.
- **Dropped frame** — A frame the browser missed its deadline to draw.
- **Compositing** — GPU moving or fading an element on its own layer.
- **will-change** — CSS hint that an element is about to animate.
- **Layout thrashing** — Animating properties that force layout recalculation every frame.

## Principles

- **Anticipation** — Small wind-up in the opposite direction before a move.
- **Follow-through** — Parts keep moving and settle after the main motion stops.
- **Squash & stretch** — Deforming to convey weight, speed, and flexibility.
- **Perceived performance** — The right animation makes an interface feel faster.
