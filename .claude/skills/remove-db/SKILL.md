description: Use when forking this template for a project that does not need a database, auth, or file storage. Removes Cloudflare D1 / R2 / Better Auth / Drizzle ORM. The Cloudflare Workers deployment stays intact.

# Remove DB / Auth / Storage

Strips the template down to a frontend-only TanStack Start app by removing:

- Cloudflare D1 + Drizzle ORM (database)
- Cloudflare R2 (avatar storage)
- Better Auth (Google OAuth)

**The Cloudflare Workers deployment is deliberately kept.** Only the *bindings*
(D1, R2) and the auth vars leave `wrangler.toml`, so `bun run deploy` keeps
working the moment this procedure finishes.

What else stays: the app shell, shared UI (`src/shared/ui`, header,
mode-toggle, theme-provider), the sample home page, and the oxlint / oxfmt /
tsc / fallow / vitest toolchain.

## Preconditions

- `git status` is clean, and the work happens on a dedicated branch (the change set is large).

## 1. Delete source code

```bash
rm -rf src/lib/auth src/lib/cloudflare src/lib/drizzle src/lib/storage
rm -rf src/shared/entities src/shared/gateway
rm -rf src/routes/api
rm -rf src/routes/login src/routes/_authed
rm -rf src/routes/auth.auth-code-error
rm -rf src/shared/components/header/auth-navigation src/shared/components/header/user-menu
rm -f src/test/cloudflare-workers-stub.ts
```

`src/routeTree.gen.ts` is gitignored and generated, so refresh it with
`bun run generate-routes` after deleting route files.

Two things above are easy to misread as deployment removals, and neither is one:

- `src/lib/cloudflare/env.ts` has one job: `import { env } from
  "cloudflare:workers"` to hand out the D1 / R2 / secret bindings. With no
  bindings left it has no callers. The Worker itself does not need it.
- `src/test/cloudflare-workers-stub.ts` exists *only* to satisfy the vitest
  alias for that import (step 3). It goes with it.

**Do not delete `src/ssr.tsx`.** It is the Worker entry that `wrangler.toml#main`
points at. It calls `createStartHandler` and touches no binding, so
it survives this procedure untouched, including its
`satisfies ExportedHandler<CloudflareEnv>` annotation, which still typechecks
after every binding is gone (`wrangler types` emits an empty `CloudflareEnv`
interface rather than omitting it, which was verified rather than assumed).

## 2. Fix auth-dependent UI

### `src/shared/components/header/header.tsx`

Remove the `user` prop and the `Option` / `UserWithEmail` / `AuthNavigation`
imports:

```tsx
import { Link } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { ModeToggle } from "./mode-toggle/mode-toggle";

export const Header = () => (
  <header className="sticky top-0 z-50 bg-transparent backdrop-blur-md">
    <div className="flex items-center justify-between px-6 py-6">
      <div>
        <h1 className="font-medium text-2xl">
          <Link to="/">Title</Link>
        </h1>
      </div>
      <div className="flex items-center gap-5">
        <Link to="/" className="text-gray-400 text-sm">
          Link1
        </Link>
        <Link to="/" className="text-gray-400 text-sm">
          Link2
        </Link>
        <ModeToggle />
      </div>
    </div>
  </header>
);
```

### `src/routes/__root.tsx`

- Delete the `currentUserQueryOptions` import and the `loader` option.
- Delete `const { data: user } = useSuspenseQuery(currentUserQueryOptions());` and render `<Header />` without props.

### `src/routes/index/-components/home-content.ts`

The sample home page hardcodes the stack. Remove the `認証` and `データ` rows
from the `同梱されているもの` section of the `SPECS` array, which carry
`Better Auth` and `Drizzle ORM`. Note: the step 7 residual grep
will **not** catch these, because `"Better Auth"` has a space and
`"Drizzle ORM"` is capitalized, so neither matches the `better-auth` /
`drizzle` (lowercase, case-sensitive) patterns. Fix them here explicitly.

### Residual auth references

```bash
grep -rn "signIn\|signOut\|session\|currentUserQueryOptions\|AuthNavigation\|UserMenu\|UserWithEmail" src/
```

Remove every hit individually.

## 3. Update build / test config

`vite.config.ts` needs **no change**, because the `cloudflare()` plugin is what builds
the Worker, and it stays.

### `vitest.config.mts`: drop the `cloudflare:workers` alias

The alias only existed to stub that import for `src/lib/cloudflare/env.ts`, which
step 1 deleted. Remove the `alias` block and the now-unused `node:path` import.

Keep the `coverage` block. It is the per-file 100% branch gate that AGENTS.md's
Testing section names this file as the home of, and dropping it retires that gate
silently. Inside it, remove the `coverageExclude` entry
`"src/routes/api/auth.$.ts"` and the comment above it, because step 1 deletes that
route. Then read the remaining entries against the tree step 1 leaves and drop any
other one that names a file it deleted.

### `tools/oxlint-plugins/arch-rules.js`: prune the dead layer bans

`LAYER_RULES` encodes as import bans the layer order AGENTS.md's Rules section
names. Each key is a layer `layerOf` returns, and its entry bans a target by
path (`paths`), by the layer `layerOf` gives that target (`layers`), or by bare
specifier (`externals`). Step 1 deletes the gateway and entity layers and the
`src/lib/` adapters the browser bans name, so drop the `gateway` and `entity`
keys, every `layers` entry naming one of them, and every `paths` entry whose
target step 1 removed. Drop the matching names from `ROLE_BY_SEGMENT` and
`layerOf`.
Remove those entries together with the cases in `arch-rules.test.ts` that cover
them: `vitest.config.mts` holds this file at 100% branch coverage, so a pruned
ban with a surviving test, or the reverse, fails `bun run test`. If every ban
goes, the `layer-boundaries` rule and its entry in the `plugin` export go too.
When that happens, also remove `"arch-rules/layer-boundaries": "error"` from
`vite.config.ts`'s `lint.rules` map, because the plugin export and that entry name the same
rule ID, so dropping only one half leaves the config pointing at a rule nothing
supplies.

**Neither file under `tools/oxlint-plugins/` is deleted.** `arch-rules.js` also
carries the component and test-shape rules, `style-rules.js` is untouched by this
procedure, and `vite.config.ts` loads both by path under `lint.jsPlugins`, so removing
either file breaks the lint config for the whole fork.

## 4. Config files

### `wrangler.toml`: edit, do not delete

Delete the `[[d1_databases]]` and `[[r2_buckets]]` blocks. Keep `name`, `main`, `compatibility_date`, and `compatibility_flags`.

Delete the `[secrets]` block and the comment above it. Every name in its
`required` list is an auth secret this procedure removes, and naming a secret
there makes it required at deploy time, and `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` carries that
contract. Leaving the block behind is the one edit in this step that breaks the
deployment this skill exists to keep: `wrangler deploy` would fail on secrets the
fork has no way to supply. When a fork introduces a secret of its own, the block
comes back carrying that name.

Leave `compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]` in place unless you have
verified nothing in the remaining build needs it. It is cheap to keep, and
removing it on a hunch is how a deploy breaks in production rather than locally.

Then regenerate the env types, as AGENTS.md's *Generated types stay generated*
requires after this file changes:

```bash
bun run cf-typegen
```

### Delete what is genuinely DB-only

```bash
rm -f drizzle.config.ts
rm -rf .wrangler                # local D1 / R2 state
rm -f docs/DATABASE_SETUP.md
rm -f .env.local .env.local.example
```

`worker-configuration.d.ts` is **kept**, and so is the `# cloudflare` block in
`.gitignore` that lists it.

`scripts/setup.sh` ends by copying the env example file onto the local one.
Delete that whole `if` block from the script, and from `scripts/setup.test.ts`
delete every case and step constant naming either file. Left in place, the copy
has no source, so `bun run setup` prints `[setup] failed at: cp` and exits 1 on
every run from here on.

After deleting the env files, the only secrets path left is
`wrangler secret put`, which is where production secrets belong anyway.
`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` stays and still describes it.

## 5. Update `package.json`

```bash
bun remove better-auth drizzle-orm drizzle-kit dotenv
```

`wrangler` and `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` stay, because they are the deployment rather than the
database.

Remove these scripts: `db:generate`, `db:push`, `db:studio`, `db:pull`,
`db:push:local`.

Keep everything else, explicitly including `deploy`, `preview`, and
`cf-typegen`.

After the `bun run dead-code` run in step 8, remove any dependencies it now flags as unused.
Expected: `@hookform/resolvers` (its last consumer was the profile form).
`react-hook-form`, `sonner`, and `radix-ui` stay, because
`src/shared/ui/` still uses them.

## 6. Update docs / settings

Several documents still describe the removed stack. Read each one **end to end**
and strip every reference to the database, auth, and storage layer: D1, R2,
Drizzle, Better Auth, Google OAuth, `BETTER_AUTH_*`, and the deleted `src/`
paths.

No list of individual lines follows, for the reason AGENTS.md's Instruction
documents rule gives. Step 7's greps catch only references that contain a
matching literal, and `README.md`'s quickstart names the env example file this
procedure deletes without naming any of the terms.

Surfaces to go through: `README.md`, `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`, `docs/FORKING.md`,
and `.claude/settings.json`.

**Do not strip these while you are in there.** They are the deployment, which
this procedure keeps:

- README's `Hosting: Cloudflare Workers` line and the `ssr.tsx` entry in the
  project structure.
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` itself and every link to it.
- In `.claude/settings.json`, the `wrangler types` / `wrangler deploy` /
  `wrangler tail` / `wrangler secret:*` entries. Remove only `wrangler d1 *`,
  `wrangler r2:*`, `drizzle-kit *`, and `bun run db:*`.
- `AGENTS.md` needs no change at all, because the fork still runs on Cloudflare
  Workers.

**Places where the right edit is not a deletion:**

- `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`'s **シークレットのローテーション** section loses its
  subject, not just some lines: `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
  are the only application secrets this template has, so once they go the table,
  its heading, both example `wrangler secret put` lines, and the two paragraphs
  explaining better-auth's wiring and its fail-loud guard all go with them.
  Reduce the section to generic guidance: `wrangler secret list|put|delete`
  with no named secrets, plus the ordering rule (register the new value, verify,
  then revoke the old one). That rule's procedure still holds, but its wording
  does not: it warns that reversing the order drops **認証** during the gap, and
  there is no auth left. Generalize the consequence to whatever consumes the
  secret. Step 7's grep is ASCII-only and will not flag that word. Finally, the
  section's closing paragraph, which points local secrets at the deleted env
  file, becomes "secrets go to `wrangler secret put`".
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`'s rollback commands and their explanation survive. What
  goes is the **重要な限界** block after them (the D1-schema caveat and its
  three-step staged-migration list), which only matters when a database exists.
- `docs/FORKING.md` section 2 is entirely about swapping D1 / R2 resources, so
  it empties out, and it also holds the only pointer to `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.
  Move that pointer into section 1 and drop the section. Its headings are
  numbered, so renumber the survivors (3→2, 4→3) rather than leaving a gap.
  Section 4 (now 3) also ends by telling the reader to consult `/remove-db` for
  removing auth, which is circular advice for a fork that just ran it. Drop that
  sentence and the profile-feature deletion list with it.
- Two documented rules stop applying and their homes have to say so.
  `.env.local.example` and `docs/DATABASE_SETUP.md` describe the standing
  exception that lets drizzle-kit's `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` sit on disk. Removing
  drizzle-kit closes that exception, so the wording goes with the files.

## 7. Residual reference check

Scope the grep to database, auth, and storage terms. Do **not** grep for
`wrangler` / `cloudflare` / `CloudflareEnv`, because those legitimately remain in
`wrangler.toml`, `vite.config.ts`, `src/ssr.tsx`, and `package.json`, and
treating them as leftovers is what leads to deleting the deployment by mistake.

```bash
grep -rn "better-auth\|BETTER_AUTH\|drizzle\|D1Database\|R2Bucket\|AVATARS_BUCKET\|d1_databases\|r2_buckets" \
  src scripts tools package.json vite.config.ts vitest.config.mts .fallowrc.jsonc wrangler.toml \
  README.md AGENTS.md .claude/settings.json docs/DEPLOYMENT.md docs/FORKING.md
```

Read every hit and decide, because a hit is not automatically a leftover. This
grep reaches the eight literals above in the paths above and nothing else, so an
empty result carries no proof, which AGENTS.md's Instruction documents rule
states for a grep in general. One exclusion from the path list is deliberate:
generic infra checklists (e.g. `.claude/skills/launch-checklist`) keep their
generic D1 / R2 mentions.

Dead markdown links to the deleted database doc need no grep, because `bun
.claude/hooks/check-md-links.ts` fails on any link whose target is gone, and
AGENTS.md's *Verification before completion* says when the Stop gate runs it.
What it cannot see is prose that names
the file without linking it, so check that separately:

```bash
grep -rn "DATABASE_SETUP" README.md AGENTS.md .claude/ docs/DEPLOYMENT.md docs/FORKING.md
```

Hits inside this skill file are its own instructions, not leftovers. The path
discipline is the same as above and for the same reason: a dated record that
cites the file describes what was true when it was written and must not be
"fixed".

## 8. Verify

```bash
bun install
bun run generate-routes
bun run cf-typegen
bun run check
bun run test
bun run dead-code
bun run build
bun run dev      # http://my-app.localhost:1355 (portless)
bun run preview  # runs the built Worker on http://localhost:4173
```

- `typecheck` errors point at imports of deleted modules. Remove them.
- `dead-code` findings point at now-unused dependencies/exports. Remove them (see step 5).
- `preview` passing is the signal that the Worker build is still intact. If it
  fails, something in step 1 or 4 removed part of the deployment rather than the
  database.

Deploying (`bun run deploy`) should work unchanged against the same Worker name.

## 9. Commit

Split per the Commits discipline in `AGENTS.md`:

1. `feat:` remove the auth / profile / DB-access features (`src/` deletions +
   `Header` / `__root` edits)
2. `chore:` remove the D1 / R2 / Drizzle configuration (wrangler.toml bindings,
   drizzle.config.ts, vitest alias, the local-DB scripts, the env files,
   `scripts/setup.sh` and `scripts/setup.test.ts`, and `docs/DATABASE_SETUP.md`)
3. `chore:` remove the DB / auth dependencies (package.json / bun.lock)
4. `docs:` remove DB- and auth-related documentation. Stage every surface
   step 6 touched, each by its explicit path as that discipline requires:
   `README.md`, `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`, `docs/FORKING.md`,
   `.claude/settings.json`, `.env.local.example` and `wrangler.toml`. A surface
   missing from this list is a surface left uncommitted.

Intermediate commits are not individually buildable (e.g. commit 1 deletes the
vitest stub that commit 2's config change stops referencing), so verify on the
final state.
